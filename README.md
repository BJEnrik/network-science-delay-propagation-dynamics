# Abstract

In the complex airline industry, disruptions often trigger chain reactions across transportation systems, leading to delay propagation. This study applies network science, experimenting with Chauhan et al.’s methodologies using the United Airlines network, to address this challenge. It analyzes airport-airport and flight flight connection networks using centrality measures, diameter, percolation, and Chauhan et al.’s priority ranking system.

The purpose of this experiment is to identify disruptive elements, either an airport or a flight, within an airline network, further enhancing the capability to optimize flight operations. Findings reveal a hub-and-spoke topology with major airports as hubs and smaller ones as endpoints, observed in most scale-free, real-world systems. Prioritization identifies Priority 1 elements like DEN and ORD for urgent attention, with Priority 2 and 3 elements (e.g., MCO, ABQ, and GUM) also requiring focus. Notably, flights themselves may not be primary disruptors, but multiple EWR flights hint at operational issues.

The study introduces search radius adjustments as a flexible strategy for airlines to fine-tune disruption mitigation, balancing cost, and effectiveness. This network analysis serves as a guide to making the air transport system resilient against delay propagation and operational disruptions within the intricate airline industry network.
